# Go Scheduling Algorithms

This project implements various scheduling algorithms in Go.

## Project Structure

The main file of the project is `main.go`. This file contains the implementation of the scheduling algorithms and the main function that runs these algorithms.

## Algorithms

The project includes the following scheduling algorithms:

- First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Priority Scheduling

Each algorithm is implemented as a function in `main.go`.
## Usage

To run the project, use the `go run` command:

go run main.go
